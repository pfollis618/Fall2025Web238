            <h2>Medieval Galway</h2>
                <p>Galway City was founded in 1124 by the King of Connacht and the High King of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. It was originally built as both a naval base and a fort at the mouth of the River Corrib along Galway bay, with the fort given the name Dún Bhun na Gaillimhe.</p>
                <p>The arrival of Anglo-Norman settlers in Ireland between 1169-1170 would eventually lead to a power change in Galway. This happened in 1235, when Galway was invaded by Richard de Burgo, who was able to successfully capture the fort. The son of Richard, William de Burgo would go on to build the city walls of Galway to help prevent a future invasion of the city.</p>
                <p>As Galway grew, St. Nicholas’s Church was built in 1320, which can still be seen in the city in the present day. In the 14th Century, St. Nicholas became the Patron Saint of Galway. This was due to St. Nicholas’ being the Patron Saint of merchants and sailors, which was fitting for Galway as it had a thriving merchant and sailing economy.</p>

                <p>Some notable events that happened at the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Modern Age. In 1473 a fire almost destroyed Galway. In 1485, the first mayor of Galway was elected, with the first mayor being Pierce Lynch of the Lynch family. In 1477, Galway was visited by Christopher Columbus. In 1520, Dunguaire Castle was built by the O’Hynes clan. In 1584, the Spanish Arch was built, which is now an important landmark within Galway.</p>
